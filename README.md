# Johely Franco â€“ Portfolio

## Process
I designed my website as part of my user experience assignments. Starting with a map page, mood board and up to the wireframes. While I was in this process, I received the professor's feedback to improve the pages and make more responsive designs.

## Lesson learned by creating my web portfolio
- Styling by using HTML (layouts-grids, nav bars, buttons, images, customize colors)
- How to use other public CSS libraries.
- Apply what I learned about accessibility.
- First time designing a website by using wireframes.
