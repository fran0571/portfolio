# Johely Franco â€“ Portfolio

## Process
I designed my website as part of my user experience assignments. Starting with a map page, mood board and up to the wireframes. While I was in this process, I received the professor's feedback to improve the pages and make more responsive designs.

## Challenges and overcomes
The layouts by using Bootstrap it was a challenge at the beginning. I read many online lectures to understand how to get the result I wanted. I found very practical the use of all the attributes needed in one line without relying so much on a CSS file. This is what I like the most, you save code. I think it's a powerful tool that requires more time to get familiar with. However, I enjoyed that I successfully understood how it works for this purpose. In addition, I also made some changes to the main design because the style didn't work, such as the size of the buttons and the LinkedIn icon (I put a link in the footer). On the other hand, I would like to mention that I am very grateful that our web development professor gave us plenty of time to complete this project. I think he understands that we all struggled more than we wanted to in other courses that took up most of our time. This gap between projects allowed me to complete this assignment in a timely manner.
